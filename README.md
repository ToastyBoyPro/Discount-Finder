# Discount-Finder
Finds the discount available based off the user's age

The purpose of this application was meant as practice in using if/else statements in JavaScript with minimal HTML and CSS added.]

Through this simple exercise, I also practiced the following concepts:
* Working with the DOM
* Storing function results into variables
* Using addEventListener instead of onclick for buttons
* Sending user input to functions by .value
* Comparison and Logical Operators
* Outputting results by .textContent
